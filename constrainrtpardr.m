%Calculate the constraints for the resource-constraint hybrid discrete 
%time-cost trade-off problems
%----------------
%Outputs:
%c is a vector of inequities.
%ceq is null vector of Eq.s
%---------------- 
%Input:
%chromosome: set of populations 
%---------------- 
%Usage:
%[c,ceq]=constrainrtpardr(chromosome)
%---------------- 
%Example:
%This is not executed as a stand-alone fuinction. Instead of specifying
%global values this function is cannot be run.
%---------------- 
%Prepositions and Requirements:
%1.)Global values P,Q,T,C,R,Ct,Cc,CR,Cs must be specified.
%2.)P should be an upper triangular matrix of the logic domain.

% P is the PopSize by PopSize scores matrix of task/dependency inclusion

% T is the column vector of time demands (=the time domain)

% R is the matrix of resource demands (=the resource domain)
% Ct is the time constraint
% Cc is the cost constraint
